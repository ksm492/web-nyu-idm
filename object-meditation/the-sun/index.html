        <p>I thought I made it clear as crystal</p>
        <p>It doesn't have to be this hard</p>
        <p>But you ain't good at reading signals</p>
        <p>When they come straight from the heart</p>
        <p>You've been thinking, you've been thinking,</p>
        <p>overthinking, you've been thinking, babe</p>
        <p>Just a little too much</p>
        <p>I wish you knew what I want</p>
        <p>I been looking, I been looking, I been looking in the mirror</p>
        <p>Making little touch-ups</p>
        <p>And I hope you know that I want you</p>
        <p>I've been sitting here waiting</p>
        <p>I've been waiting for you</p>
        <p>I've sent out invitations</p>
        <p>It's getting frustrating waiting for you</p>
        <p>I think you know what I want</p>
        <p>I think you know what I want</p>
        <p>I think you know what I want</p>
        <p>I think you know, I'm waiting for you</p>
        <p>I'll take your hand and kiss your fingers</p>
        <p>So you don't have to break the ice</p>
        <p>No need for chill just lose your filter</p>
        <p>I'm ready to dive in</p>
        <p>Melt the ice and just swim</p>
        <p>You've been thinking, you've been thinking,</p>
        <p>overthinking, you've been thinking, babe</p>
        <p>Just a little too much</p>
        <p>I wish you knew what I want</p>
        <p>We been drinking, we been drinking, we been drinking,</p>
        <p>we been drinking, babe</p>
        <p>Just a little too much</p>
        <p>And I hope you know that I want you</p>
        <p>I've been sitting here waiting</p>
        <p>I've been waiting for you</p>
        <p>I've sent out invitations</p>
        <p>It's getting frustrating waiting for you</p>

        <p>I think you know, I'm waiting for you</p>
        <p>I think you know what I want</p>
        <p>Now I think you know what I want</p>
