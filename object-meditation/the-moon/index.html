          <p>What time you coming out?</p>
          <p>We started losing light</p>
          <p>I'll never make it right</p>
          <p>If you don't wander off</p>
          <p>I'm so excited for the night</p>
          <p>All we need's my bike and your enormous house</p>
          <p>You said some day we might</p>
          <p>When I'm closer to your height,</p>
          <p>Till then we'll knock around and see</p>
          <p>If you're all I need</p>
          <p>Don't you see me I</p>
          <p>I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you</p>
          <p>And don't you need me I</p>
          <p>I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you</p>
          <p>On this night, and in this light</p>
          <p>I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you</p>
          <p>And maybe you, change your mind</p>
          <p>(I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling)</p>
          <p>I'm caught on your coat again</p>
          <p>You said, "Oh no, it's fine"</p>
          <p>I read between the lines and touched your leg again (again)</p>
          <p>I'll take it one day at a time</p>
          <p>Soon you will be mine, oh, but I want you now (I want you now)</p>
          <p>When the smoke is in your eyes, you look so alive</p>
          <p>Do you fancy sitting down with me maybe</p>
          <p>'Cause you're all I need</p>
          <p>According to your heart</p>
          <p>My place is not deliberate</p>
          <p>Feeling of your arms</p>
          <p>I don't want to be your friend, I want to kiss your neck</p>
          <p>Don't you see me I</p>
          <p>I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you</p>
          <p>And don't you need me I</p>
          <p>I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you</p>
          <p>On this night, and in this light</p>
          <p>I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you</p>
          <p>And maybe you, change your mind</p>
