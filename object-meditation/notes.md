# Object Meditation: Kissing Bunny

### What are 5 words that come to mind when I think of this object?
- Anna
- Love
- Support
- Loyal
- Together

### Are there spacial places this object is associated with?
- This object is associated with my girlfriend Anna, and where ever she is is my
home. 

### What does my object look like?
- My object is a blue, ceramic bunny that can only stay up when its kissing its other
half. But, when it's alone it falls flat on its face. Its small enough for me to
barely wrap my hand around it and short enough so that when it falls it doesn't break.

### What does my object feel like?
- My object is smooth, cold, and hollow. The paint is chipping in some areas but
for the most part, its feels just like it did the day I got it.

### What does my object sound like?
- My object clatters when it falls, so much so that every time it does I'm worried
that it broke. But when it's with the other bunny, it never falls and is silent.
I would associate it with Anna's voice, probably saying "hello!" or "give me attention!"

### What does my object smell like?
- My object doesn't smell like anything (not me or Anna). If it were a smell, it
would be Anna's perfume (Ralph Lauren, Tender Romance).

### Where did you get it?
- Anna gave me my bunny a few days before I left for New York. She has the other half
with her back home. It was a going-away gift, but more like a part of Anna coming with
me.

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
- This object makes me both happy and sad. It reminds me of Anna, which makes me
happy, but I also get very sad thinking about how far away she is and how long until
we can see each other again.

### Why did you choose it?
- I chose this object because it most strongly reminds me of Anna.

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?
- I see a representation of my long distance relationship, while to others, my object
just looks like a faulty bunny.

### Is it one of a kind?
- In a way by object is one of a kind, in that only Anna has the original other half,
but I think that these ceramic kissing bunnies were most likely part of a series.

### How do you interact with it?
- For the most part, my kissing bunny sits alone on the edge of my desk face down.
Sometimes, when I miss Anna, I kiss its nose. I hope that one day, both kissing
bunnies will be reunited again.

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with?
- My kissing bunny is in a serious, long distance relationship with Anna's kissing
bunny.

### What is a specific memory you have with this object?
- This object reminds me of the last day of summer I spent with Anna before leaving
for school, when she gave me my kissing bunny and showed me the one she has. When I left,
so did my half of our kissing bunnies.
